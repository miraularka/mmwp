### Mirau's Modular Website Platform

A personal pet project to make a rather simple, easy to use website platform that utilizes Discord as a means to create and update accounts for users in lieu of e-mail. An emphasis on digital collectibles and linking databases from various game servers in order to establish a single, clean community hub.
